# Distributed-computing
Distributed computing Class Project
lamport and ricard&agrawala implementation in C

This project needs te be run 7 times the code changing:

Main.c
```
17 #define portMeu 8200
``` 
adding +1 each run
so it will be:
```
8200
8201
8202
...
8206
```

you will see that only one of the 7 process it's printing at any time given.
